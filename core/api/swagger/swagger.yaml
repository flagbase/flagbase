    description: "Workspaces represent a collection of projects. It can be used to group an individual or organisation's projects."
  - name: workspace-access
    x-displayName: Workspace Access
    description: A new workspace-access link should be created in order to enable the appropriate acess permissions to this resource and its children.
  - name: projects
    x-displayName: Project Management
    description: Projects represent a collection of feature flags and their respective rollout rules etc. Projects also have different contexts which are applied (i.e. environments).

    x-displayName: Project Access
    description: A new project-access link should be created in order to enable the appropriate acess permissions to this resource and its children.
  - name: environments
    x-displayName: Environment Management
    description: 'Environments are used to maintain isolated contexts for project resources (such as feature flags, rollout rules etc). For example, you can have Test and Production environments, which contain completely separate rollout rules etc.'
  - name: environment-access
    x-displayName: Environment Access
    description: A new environment-access link should be created in order to enable the appropriate acess permissions to this resource and its children.
  - name: flags
    x-displayName: Flag Management
    description: 'A feature flag (aka feature switch) represent the current state of a feature. Feature flags consists of variations (ie. boolean (true, false) or multi-variant (A, B, C)), where each variation represents a unique state of a particular feature.'
  - name: variations
    x-displayName: Variation Management
    description: A variation represents a particular feature flag state. Feature flags usually consist of multiple variations (e.g. True and False). We can rollout different feature variations to particular users or user segments.
  - name: targeting
    x-displayName: Targeting Management
    description: 'Targeting is essentially a rollout configuration which defines how feature flag variations are rolled out to specific users. Rollout rules can target specific user or segments. After users "evaluate" a specific rollout rule and obtain a flag variation.'
  - name: targeting-rules
    x-displayName: Targeting Rules
    description: Targeting rules allow you to explicity define how you want to target feature flags to users. You are required to specify logical statements which are evaluated when serving flags to users.
  - name: targeting-percentages
    x-displayName: Targeting Percentages
    description: Targeting percentages are used when you want to conduct a incremental rollouts on a certain percentage of users. It allows you to rollout variations to explicit percentages of your whole cohort base.
  - name: traits
    x-displayName: Trait Management
    description: Traits represent a particular characteristic of a particular identity (aka users). You can create segments using these traits. Traits can also be used to target variations to specific users.
  - name: segments
    x-displayName: Segment Management
    description: Segments represent a specific group of users based on their attributes. You can define a specific user segments using a set rules. Rules contain conditions that are applied to attributes.
  - name: segment-rules
    x-displayName: Segment Rules
    description: "Segment rules consists of conditions that need to match a specific user's attributes (i.e. identity traits) ."
  - name: identities
    x-displayName: Identity Management
    description: An identity is an instance of a user. Identities are initially created when the first evaluate a feature flag (i.e. by using the SDK).
